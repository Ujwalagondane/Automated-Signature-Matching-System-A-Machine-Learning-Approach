# Automated-Signature-Matching-System-A-Machine-Learning-Approach
To address the challenges of document authentication, this project introduces the development of an Automated Signature Matching System (ASMS) that harnesses the power of machine learning and computer vision techniques. 

# Goal
Design and implement a user-friendly system that empowers users to verify signatures seamlessly and accurately. 
The system integrates a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate intuitive signature capturing and interaction with the ASMS. 
Users can either capture signatures directly through webcams or browse and load signature images from files, making the process accessible and adaptable to various scenarios.
